# Consistency Improvements in Emotion Dice Project

## Overview
This document summarizes the changes made to improve consistency in the codebase and image file naming of the Emotion Dice project.

## Issues Identified
1. **Spelling errors in directory and file names:**
   - "agressive" directory (should be "aggressive")
   - "aweful" directory (should be "awful")
   - "firghtened.png" file (should be "frightened.png")

2. **Inconsistent naming conventions:**
   - Some directories and files had spaces in their names (e.g., "let down", "out of control.png")
   - The JSON data uses mixed case, while the image files and directories are lowercase

## Changes Made
1. **Created a script to fix naming inconsistencies:**
   - Created `fix_naming_inconsistencies.sh` to automate the renaming process
   - The script fixes spelling errors and replaces spaces with hyphens in directory and file names

2. **Fixed specific naming issues:**
   - Renamed directory: "agressive" -> "aggressive"
   - Renamed directory: "aweful" -> "awful"
   - Renamed file: "firghtened.png" -> "frightened.png"
   - Renamed directory: "let down" -> "let-down"
   - Renamed file: "out of control.png" -> "out-of-control.png"

3. **Updated code to handle the new naming convention:**
   - Modified the `findImagePath` function in `App.jsx` to replace spaces with hyphens in path parts
   - This ensures that the code correctly generates image paths that match the new naming convention

## Benefits
1. **Improved consistency:** All directory and file names now follow a consistent pattern (lowercase, no spaces, correct spelling)
2. **Better maintainability:** Consistent naming makes the codebase easier to understand and maintain
3. **Reduced errors:** Fixing spelling errors and standardizing naming conventions reduces the likelihood of path-related errors

## Future Recommendations
1. **Enforce naming conventions:** Use linting tools or pre-commit hooks to enforce naming conventions for new files
2. **Document conventions:** Add a section to the project documentation that describes the naming conventions for future contributors
3. **Automate checks:** Implement automated checks to identify and flag inconsistencies in the codebase
